# Databricks notebooks

This directory contains source notebooks for Scala Fundamentals,
suitable for import into [Databricks Community Edition](http://databricks.com/ce).

Note that some of the notebooks contain some metadata that is designed to be
parsed by a (proprietary internal Databricks) tool, to split the notebooks
into "exercise notebooks" and "solution notebooks". If you import those
notebooks, you'll get both exercises _and_ solutions (which is fine).
